/*
1. Form - to log in the users with their names
2. Player - player count, name of the player, distance that they have travelled, rank
3. Game - handles the game with gameStates

PlayerCount < 4
game State = wait (0)

playerCOunt = 4
game state = play (1)


Programming Style - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)
- Look at components of the game as real life objects
- Create design/blueprint before creating the object (CLASS)
- Properties & functions of the class of the objects


1. FORM 
    - input box - name
    - play button - to log in
    - when button pressed - player's name ---> database
    - new player object will be created
2. PLAYER
    - Contains info
    - name
    - rank
    - distance
    - read & write to the database the info for playercount
3. GAME 
    - Holding game states
    - Displaying the form when it is wait state
    - playing the game when it is play state
    - Ending the game when end state
